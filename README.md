# Websites issues

A repository of issues encountered while browsing the Web.

I don't know if I'm cursed or anything, but I encounter a lot of issues while browsing daily on the Web.

These are sometimes just visual glitches, that make no real harm, but I often stumble upon real issues with services that doesn't work, or at least not as I thought they would.

You'll find only [issues](https://github.com/nhoizey/websites-issues/issues) in this repository.

Feel free adding your own issues, but please:
- be careful first to try at least twice before submitting the issue
- describe the issue as much as possible (in english) and add screenshots when possible

I'll add labels myself on every openned issue.
